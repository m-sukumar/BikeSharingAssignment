# Bike Sharing Assignment
The target goal of this project is is to build a Linear regression model whihc predict the deman of bike share of Boom Bike based on multiple features

## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. 

Boom Bike is provides users such a bike sharing system. Due to recent covid lockdown it suffered dip in its revenue.So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.  Therefore BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits. To achive this goal they want to determine the factors which controls the demand of bike sharing from the historical data .
